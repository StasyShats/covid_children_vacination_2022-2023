## Parents' Response to Vaccinating Their Children against COVID-19: An Answer Sheet

## This overview provides an overview of parents' responses to vaccinating their children against COVID-19, as well as to mandatory and recommended vaccinations such as HPV, rotavirus, meningococcal, and others.

## Methodology 
- Data Collection: Answer Sheet Form
- Location: Bratislava District
- Time: Year 2022
- Age of Children: Up to 18 years old

## Hypotheses:
- It is hypothesized that parents who have received the COVID-19 vaccine have also ensured that their children have been vaccinated against the disease.
- It is hypothesized that parents who have adhered to the recommended vaccination schedule have ensured that their children have been vaccinated against COVID-19.
- It is hypothesized that parents with higher levels of education have ensured that their children have been vaccinated against COVID-19.
- It is hypothesized that there are significant variations in the vaccination rates of children against COVID-19 across different age groups.

## Results:
Our findings support that parents who are vaccinated against COVID-19 are more likely to have their children vaccinated against the virus as well (p=0.000).
We also found that parents who adhere to the recommended vaccination schedule are more likely to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 (p=0.001).
Our results suggest that there is no significant difference in the likelihood of children being vaccinated against COVID-19 between parents with higher and lower education levels (p=0.376).
Furthermore, we observed a statistically significant difference in the vaccination rates of children against COVID-19 across different age groups, with older children being more vaccinated compared to their younger counterparts (p=1.1256869771381537e-05).
